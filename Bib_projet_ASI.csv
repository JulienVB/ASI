Elle fait partie des toutes premières méthodes capables de détecter efficacement et en temps réel des objets dans une image. Inventée à l'origine pour détecter des visages, elle peut également être utilisée pour détecter d'autres types d'objets comme des voitures ou des avions. La méthode de Viola et Jones a été l'une des méthodes les plus connues et les plus utilisées, en particulier pour la détection de visages et la détection de personnes. En tant que procédé d'apprentissage supervisé, la méthode de Viola et Jones nécessite de quelques centaines à plusieurs milliers d'exemples de l'objet que l'on souhaite détecter, pour entraîner un classifieur. Une fois son apprentissage réalisé, ce classifieur est utilisé pour détecter la présence éventuelle de l'objet dans une image en parcourant celle-ci de manière exhaustive, à toutes les positions et dans toutes les tailles possibles. Considérée comme étant l'une des plus importantes méthodes de détection d'objet, la méthode de Viola et Jones est notamment connue pour avoir introduit plusieurs notions reprises ensuite par de nombreux chercheurs en vision par ordinateur, à l'exemple de la notion d'image intégrale ou de la méthode de classification construite comme une cascade de classifieurs boostés. Cette méthode bénéficie d'une implémentation sous licence BSD dans OpenCV, une bibliothèque très utilisée en vision par ordinateur.","2020-10-12","2021-12-29 16:59:44","2021-12-29 16:59:44","2021-12-29 16:59:44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","fr","Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","","","","Wikipedia","","Page Version ID: 175497864","","/Users/julienvanbelle/Zotero/storage/A3ZEYNEF/index.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our approach, named SSD, discretizes the output space of bounding boxes into a set of default boxes over different aspect ratios and scales per feature map location. At prediction time, the network generates scores for the presence of each object category in each default box and produces adjustments to the box to better match the object shape. Additionally, the network combines predictions from multiple feature maps with different resolutions to naturally handle objects of various sizes. SSD is simple relative to methods that require object proposals because it completely eliminates proposal generation and subsequent pixel or feature resampling stages and encapsulates all computation in a single network. This makes SSD easy to train and straightforward to integrate into systems that require a detection component. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC, COCO, and ILSVRC datasets confirm that SSD has competitive accuracy to methods that utilize an additional object proposal step and is much faster, while providing a unified framework for both training and inference. For \(300 \times 300\) input, SSD achieves 74.3 % mAP on VOC2007 test at 59 FPS on a Nvidia Titan X and for \(512 \times 512\) input, SSD achieves 76.9 % mAP, outperforming a comparable state of the art Faster R-CNN model. Compared to other single stage methods, SSD has much better accuracy even with a smaller input image size.
